/**
 * The responses the dashboard is drawn from.
 *
 * A dashboard is only convincing on a body of answers, and a template cannot
 * ship real ones — so they are generated here, from the definition itself: walk
 * the questions, and answer each one the way a population would. That keeps the
 * data honest as the forms change (edit a form in the Creator, and the dashboard
 * follows), and it keeps this file small: no 20,000-line fixture.
 *
 * Two properties matter for the charts to look like anything:
 *
 *  - **skew.** Uniform noise draws flat bars, which say nothing. Choices are
 *    weighted so a couple of options lead, ratings lean high the way satisfaction
 *    scores really do, and each form gets its own favourite so no two dashboards
 *    have the same silhouette.
 *  - **determinism.** A seeded generator means the numbers are the same on the
 *    server, in the browser and in a screenshot taken tomorrow.
 *
 * Every response also carries a `timestamp`, which is what the dashboard's date
 * filter works on.

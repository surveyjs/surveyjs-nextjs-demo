  aiHint:
    "The document is a CMS-1500 (02/12) Health Insurance Claim Form, the standard US professional claim. Every question below names the numbered box it comes from in its hint, and each box is labelled with that number on the form - read the value out of that box and nowhere else. Never carry a value over from a neighbouring box, and never repeat a value you have already used for a different question unless the form really prints it twice. Checkbox geometry matters and is not uniform: in boxes 3, 6 and 11a the little square sits to the RIGHT of the word it belongs to (so an X between 'Self' and 'Spouse' belongs to Self), while in boxes 10a-10c, 11d, 20 and 27 the square sits to the LEFT of its YES or NO label. Dates are printed as MM DD YY in three adjacent little boxes; return them as YYYY-MM-DD, reading a two-digit year 00-40 as 20xx and 41-99 as 19xx. Money is printed as dollars and cents in two adjacent columns with no decimal point, so '145 00' means 145.00. Diagnosis codes are printed with the decimal point left out: return the code with the point put back where the ICD-10 standard has it, so 'M5451' becomes M54.51 and 'E785' becomes E78.5. The left half of the form is about the patient and any secondary policy, the right half about the insured and the payer. When a box on the form is blank, or the question is not on the form at all, return null for it - not an empty string. Never invent a value.",

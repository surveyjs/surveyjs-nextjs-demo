 * Survey Creator, opened on one form.

 * This is the commercial half of the story the whole template tells: the same
 * definitions the pages render are edited here in the visual designer, and what
 * is saved is what those pages then render — the round trip a buyer is asking
 * about. Everything the previous JSON-editor page did by hand (a Monaco pane, a
 * linter bar, a live preview beside it) is a tab in here.
 *
 * Edits are kept per browser (localStorage — see `survey-json.ts`), so the URL
 * is safe to hand around: what a visitor changes is theirs alone, and the server
 * keeps serving the definition that ships with the template.
 *
 * The users a personalized form is rendered for are not edited here. They belong
 * to the demo — its toolbar signs in as any of the preset ones and opens the
 * account in a popup — and this page only borrows the first of them, so that
 * `{user.firstName}` resolves to somebody in the Preview tab.
